Do you think the predicted tags "PRON AUX AUX NOUN PUNCT" for the sentence "They can can fish ." are correct? Use your understanding of parts-of-speech from the notes.

Based on general parts-of-speech rules, "They" is generally classified as Pronoun while "fish" is more commonly classified as Noun.
